## Overview

This project performs a comprehensive **spatial transcriptomics analysis** of human breast cancer tissue using the **10x Genomics Visium** platform. By combining whole-transcriptome gene expression with spatial coordinates, we map the cellular landscape of the **tumor microenvironment (TME)** directly onto tissue histology.

Unlike bulk RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics reveals *where* genes are expressed — distinguishing tumor cores from invasive margins, stromal regions, and immune infiltrates — all within a single tissue section.

## Key Findings

## Methods Summary

### Quality Control
Spots with fewer than 200 genes, fewer than 500 UMIs, or more than 15% mitochondrial reads were excluded. Genes detected in fewer than 3 spots were removed.

### Normalization
Total counts per spot were normalized to 10,000 (CPM-like) followed by log1p transformation. Raw counts were preserved in `adata.layers['counts']` and `adata.raw` for downstream analyses.

### Dimensionality Reduction
Top 3,000 highly variable genes were selected using the Seurat v3 method. PCA was computed on scaled HVGs (50 components). A k-nearest neighbor graph (k=15, 30 PCs) was used for UMAP embedding.

### Clustering
Leiden community detection was applied at resolutions 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, and 1.0. Resolution 0.5 (9 clusters) was selected based on spatial coherence and biological interpretability.

### Spatial Statistics
A Visium hexagonal spatial neighbors graph (6 neighbors) was constructed. Moran's I was computed for all genes to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs). Neighborhood enrichment, co-occurrence, and Ripley's L statistics were computed using Squidpy.
